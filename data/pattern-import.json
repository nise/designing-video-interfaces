	"context": "The provided video learning environment contains a limited set of instructional videos. Other relevant videos  might have been found or stored outside the platform.",
	"problem": "Videos outside the provided learning environment are difficult to handle for both instructors and learners. First of all the learners need to know about the video. Second, the videos need to become accessible and remain accessible for all learners. Even if they are known and accessible the user will experience media breaks and might be destructed by unrelated content on the remote platforms. %Although the system only provides a limited set of videos users come up with interesting material. They produced it on their own or found it somewhere else in the web.",
	"solution": "Provide a learning environment where videos from different sources can be integrated in a consistent manner. Make sure learners get sufficient privileges to upload or embed resources in the system"
}, {
	"name": "Annotated Timeline",
	"context": "Enriched videos incorporate time-related contents like chapter marks or tags as well as further contents like pictures, websites or hyperlinks. Their presentation is determined by a temporal layout that contains the position and dimension of these events and marks",
	"problem": "The distribution of time-related and time-dependent annotations within the duration of a video is neither visible nor is it possible to navigate precisely to the corresponding positions in time. The learner should have a chance to develop its own mental model on how the interactive video works, and how its temporal events and marks relate to the playback time.",
	"solution": "Indicate temporal events and scenes alongside the timeline by different icons, colours or on parallel tracks. Allow users to jump to these temporal positions."

	"context": "A learning environment is not closed, but rather open for contributions made by teachers and students.",
	"problem": "Compared to text or images, it is difficult to modify a video file. Videos are technically self-contained, which implies their use as a broadcast medium in terms of teaching and learning. The involved people are impeded from making contributions or additions that are directly related to the time-based information structure.",
	"solution": "Make video extensible for the user through spatial and temporal annotations. Place them on top or beside the video."
}, {
	"name": "Appropriate Delivery",
	"context": "The file size as well as the experienced image quality of a video is determined by the product of the pixels per frame, their colour depth, and the frame rate. When delivering web video there is a trade-off between fast delivery and the quality of the audiovisual content. This is determined by the individual system and network capabilities of the user",
	"problem": "While users expect a fast delivery of a high-quality video they would be overwhelmed in finding the optimal way of content delivery.",
	"solution": "Automatically deliver an appropriate video of maximum frame size and quality in a supported format that does not conflict with the possible data transfer capacity. Therefore provide several instances of the video that correlate with common screen resolutions, supported video formats, and network delivery capacities."

For instance, learners may want to close individual knowledge gaps or they may want to deepen a topic before or instead of continuing the playback. In this cases, they might not learn as much as they could if they continue the video. But if they would leave the video with an unclear goal in mind they will loose track towards the learning objectives.",

	"name": "Detail on Demand",
	"context": "Transfer of knowledge requires particular prior knowledge. The prior knowledge of individual learners almost always differs to some extent.",
	"problem": "Within an instructional video you can neither expect the same prior knowledge from every learner nor can you explain every mentioned term or concept in detail to consider individual prior knowledge.",
	"solution": "Provide necessary prior knowledge as details on demand. Therefore, use a hyperlink that  refers to a segment of another video. As soon as the playback of the on-demand video ends the presentation of the original video should be continued"

	"name": "Direct Authoring",
	"context": "The video delivered in the player can be extended by additional time-dependent and time-related contents. These annotations can be created, edited or removed.",
	"problem": "The playback facilities are typically separated from the authoring tools. For adding or editing an annotation the user needs to switch from the player to the authoring interface in the back-end of the application. As a consequence, the task flow of watching and annotating is interrupted. Furthermore, it has a negative effect on the viewing experience. Finally, users hesitate to annotate content, because they do not want to loose focus on the current scene or topic. % In the player the authoring results are often presented in a different way than in the authoring environment.",

In case one might have identified a cross-relation between videos the relation remains implicit and not visible for other learners.",
	"solution":"Therefore, make content relations explicit by linking segments in one video with another video or learning resource. Distinguish visually, whether a link points to another video within the same environment or to any other external resource.

	"context": "The moving images of a video contain great visual details.",
	"problem": "Understanding a visual presented process or animation sometimes requires the user repeat the presentation multiple times in order to grasp all relevant details. Jumping back on timeline after every run is very cumbersome, especially if the requested scene is only a few seconds long.",

	"context": "A video has been augmented with different types of annotations. Some of the annotations overlap in their temporal extent",
	"problem": "Overlaps and clusters make it difficult to overview annotations that are displayed on a single timeline track. When managing these content annotations might be overlooked and ignored in the clutter.",

	"name": "Object Tracking",
	"context": "An annotated video has been augmented with \textsc{Overlays} whose temporal and spatial position is related to a certain visual object in the video. This visual object can change its position over time",
	"problem": "The semantic relation of the annotation and its corresponding object in the video can not be ensured if they are not presented close to each other. Without this spatial context information an annotation can become meaningless. % Spatial proximity between a time-depending annotation and its semantically corresponding object in the video can not be ensured if the object is moving.",
	"solution": "Therefore, dynamically adjust the position of the annotation by analysing the movement of its corresponding object. Computer vision algorithm can be used for tracking the position of an object over time."
}, {
	"name": "Overlays",
	"context": "The instructor or students want to augment the video with further information. These additional contents can be synchronized with the video. The available space to present these contents is limited by the display size and the size of the video that is required to distinguish all necessary content.",

}, {
	"name": "Playback Speed",
	"context": "The presentation of video contents can result in the two extremes of a cognitive load. On the one hand, overload can be caused by fast scene changes or volatile details in visual dynamic processes. Mental underload, on the other hand, is related to almost unchanging images or irrelevant content",
	"problem": "The density of presented information in a video differs from the expected level of detail, sometimes it is perceived as too slow, sometimes as too fast.",

	"context": "A set of videos that strongly build on each other in a sequential manner should be rather interlinked with each other or concatenated in the way of \textsc{Sequential Media}. Hence additional learning resources are not intended to provide a linear learning path. The content of a video bears many implicit ties to other learning resources. Learners can be motivated to follow these ties and consume resources that are part of the learning environment",
	"problem": "The desire to watch another video awakes during or after a video presentation. The viewer might be looking for another video during the playback if the one presented does not fulfil his/her needs. After completion, the viewer would like to continue with a subsequent or deepening lecture. In both cases, the learner should not leave the learning environment if he/she could proceed the learning with an appropriate resource.",
